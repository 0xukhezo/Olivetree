              Sophisticated lenders gain wider access to investment
              opportunities, enhancing their deal flow and potential for capital
              deployment. Individual professionals or retail investors gain
              access to high-yield credit deals that have not been widely
              available in the past.
              <br /> Traditional banks moving further away from taking credit
              risk creates space in the market for private capital to benefit
              from these attractive investments.

              As soon as any external reliance is introduced to a contract, it
              becomes less resilient as it takes on the liability of dependency.
              Oracles introduce external data and thus an exploitable
              vulnerability.
