            How does taking out a loan on Olivetree compare to Aave or Compound?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-[24px] mb-[42px]">
            Peer-to-Pool (or Peer-to-Contract) protocols such as Aave or
            Compound are attractive for specific approved collateral types (ETH,
            CRV, etc.) and strategies such as flash loans.
            <br />
            Olivetree enables borrowers to finance any combination of arbitrary
            assets within a single financing, at a predictable fixed-rate. There
            are no forced-liquidations and borrowers may repay the position at
            any time.

          <h2>Why should I lend capital on Olivetree?</h2>
          <p className="mt-[24px] mb-[42px]">
            Sophisticated lenders gain wider access to investment opportunities,
            enhancing their deal flow and potential for capital deployment.
            Individual professionals or retail investors gain access to
            high-yield credit deals that have not been widely available in the
            past.
            <br /> Traditional banks moving further away from taking credit risk
            creates space in the market for private capital to benefit from
            these attractive investments.

          <h2>How am I protected from forced liquidations?</h2>
          <p className="mt-[24px] mb-[42px]">
            Peer-to-Syndicate loans on Olivetree are isolated debt structures
            where the lender(s) take on the credit risk. This has the combined
            benefits of allowing for unique loan structures and terms, while
            also avoiding the major risks of Peer-to-Pool models, such as
            cascading liquidations and oracle accuracy.

          <h2>Why is it safer to have no reliance on oracles?</h2>
          <p className="mt-[24px] mb-[42px]">
            As soon as any external reliance is introduced to a contract, it
            becomes less resilient as it takes on the liability of dependency.
            Oracles introduce external data and thus an exploitable
            vulnerability.
